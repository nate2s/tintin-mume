rfind [c|string] - performs a case-insensitive, fuzzy search for rooms that contain string in their names. If  'c' is supplied instead of a string, will perform an case-sensitive, exact search for the last captured room name from the game. It is important to use this command to make sure there are no other rooms with the same name as the current one before syncing with the 'sync' command, or for checking that a search query only has one result before passing it to the 'run' command.
run [c|numeric room ID|string] - start automatically walking from your current location to a destination. If the argument is a numeric room ID, will run to the room with the given ID.  If 'c' is given, will recalculate a new route to your previous destination and start running. If neither a numeric room ID or 'c' are given, will perform a case-insensitive, fuzzy search for room names that match string, and start running to the first result. Make sure you search for the string using the rfind command first, to insure there is only one possible room for the 'run' command to run to.
unrun - If you are currently running, will stop.
sync - Sets your location in the map to the last captured room name from the game. Make sure to use this command as soon as possible after logging on, and only use it in a room with a unique name.  If you are unsure if the current room name is unique, use 'rfind c'.

Reenter Script:

Secrets Script:
dadd [secret name] [direction] - Add a secret exit to the current room in the secrets database.  For example: 'dadd colvert e'. Short forms of directions [e|ea|eas] will automatically be converted to their long form 'east'.
ddel [room name|all] [direction|all] - Deletes 1 or more secret exits from the room. Like the 'dadd' command, direction names are automatically converted to their long forn. The word 'all' is a wild card. If there are no more secret exits for the current room after the deletion, the room is automatically removed from the database. Examples: 'ddel wall e' (delete the secret named 'wall' that's to the 'east', but leave the wall that's too the north), 'ddel all e' (delete all secret exits in the room that are located to the east), 'ddel stonedoor all' (Delete all secrets named 'stonedoor' from the room, no matter what direction they are located), 'ddel all all' (delete all the secrets from the room, and remove the room entry from the database).
ddis [string] - Displays all the secrets (if any) for a room or rooms. If the user provides a string to be searched for, a case-insensitive, fuzzy search is performed for all room names in the database matching string. Otherwise, a case-sensitive, exact search is performed for the last captured room name from the mud.
ddo - Open all secret exits in the current room.

playsound [file|directory] - Play a sound file from the 'sounds' directory. If a file name is given, it will be played in the background.
